# Project-CovidDetection

This project outlines the results of implementing a deep neural network known as a convolutional neural network to see if a neural network can be trained in order to predict the presence of Covid-19 in the lungs and assist radiologists at detecting Covid-19 using lung computed tomography scans. Deep learning has proven to be more powerful then original machine learning methods, and with this they are deployed amongst all computer science data problems, such as image classification, which is what this project focuses on, language processing and AI. In order to make sure the model is trained efficiently, a segmentation algorithm is also created which segments any lung tissue from NIFTI CT scans. The results and findings from this project are then discussed and outlined, to answer the question, Could a deep neural network assist radiologists in diagnosing Covid-19?.

# Installation
To use the program, first download the sourcecode and open the folder in the terminal. From here, run the command pip install -r requirements.txt. This will install all needed dependencies for the code to function. 

Now just using python, run the command python3 main.py, and the GUI will open.
